# Wintun2socks
A C++/CX wrapper for lwIP that turns tun packets into sockets

**Going forward, [YtFlowCore](https://github.com/YtFlow/YtFlowCore) is the next core component of YtFlow and provides the "tun2socks" functionality with better reusability and performance. Wintun2socks is not used or maintained any more**
